# password_checker
Hi!

This script connects to the pwned api and checks if your password has been ever hacked. All passwords are parsed through from the password.txt file and shown in the console. I have used the top 100 worst passwords from Forbes as an example. You can find this list by clicking this link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/12/14/ranked-the-worlds-100-worst-passwords/?sh=7e1a4f0f69b4 .
